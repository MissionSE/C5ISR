DrawerSafeViewPager
===================

This library (which consists of a single class) is an extension of Google's [ViewPager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/ViewPager.html). It creates a "gutter" under which the ViewPager will ignore any input, so as to remove the visual jitter when there is also a NavigationDrawer (or any other type of gutter-focused UI component) present.
