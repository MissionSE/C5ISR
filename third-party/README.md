Third-party Libraries
=====================

This directory contains third-party libraries used by the examples and libraries in this repository.

Each directory, named after the third-party library it contains, contains:

* the library, as an archived .zip, or unpacked if necessary,
* any licenses included in the original distribution, if applicable
* a short markdown file (.md) describing the purpose of the third-party library, based off of the [third-party template](../documentation/templates/ThirdParty.md).
